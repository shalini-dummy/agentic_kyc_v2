  "mailBody": "Dear Shubham,\n\nThank you for sharing the internal data to update the checklist. I have reviewed the details, and I've noted that there are several missing items concerning the company directorship, tax documentation, regulatory compliance, and PEP screening. Unfortunately, it appears that J.P. Morgan Securities PLC has not disclosed or plans to disclose information on these specific areas in their 2023 Annual Report.\n\nIf you require further assistance or if there's anything else I can help with, please feel free to let me know.\n\nBest regards,\nSurbhi Nagori\nsurbhi.nagori@capgemini.com"
